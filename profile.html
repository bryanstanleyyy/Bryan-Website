                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Bryan Jones, a hardworking and enthusiastic computer science student pursuing both an M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science at George Mason University through the Bachelor's to Accelerated Master's program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about programming, problem-solving, and exploring advanced topics like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Currently, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my programming skills, contribute to team goals, and gain experience in building a career in software engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My experience spans multiple areas including data analysis, cybersecurity mentoring, AI research, and technical support. I've had the privilege of working with organizations like MIT, CodePath, and various tech companies, gaining diverse perspectives on the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, playing soccer, basketball, and chess, as well as working on tech-related projects and participating in hackathons like PatriotHacks and HackOverflow.
                    </p>
